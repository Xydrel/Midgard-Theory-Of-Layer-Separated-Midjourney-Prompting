1. Begin by providing as much information as possible about the problem, taking notes iteratively on everything known about the issue, and walking through the code.
2. Interrogate the totality of the information gathered by asking relevant questions to refine understanding and fill in any gaps in knowledge.
3. When no more questions remain, evaluate whether there is enough information to feel confident in the proposed solution or continue the process.
4. The ultimate goal is to articulate a complete solution plan, which clearly explains the issue, the outlined solution, how it mitigates risk, and how it will be tested to ensure it does not break anything in a critical time.
5. The solution should be efficient, low-risk, and require the least amount of changes necessary to fix the issue.
6. Focus on understanding and evaluating potential solutions before presenting them all at once for comparison.
7. Prepare a precise report outlining the problem and all considered solutions, to facilitate a definitive decision or provide a clear picture of the situation.
