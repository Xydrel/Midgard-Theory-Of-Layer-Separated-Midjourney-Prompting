Example usage
I would like a prompt for a magical world that is in eternal conflict. they are fighting a never ending war over magic 
and it is destroying the world itself. there magical leylines all around this world and the use of magic is 
causing the world to crumble with a giant bottomless chasm that is splitting the earth. This world has many diverse 
and beautiful natural biomes. but we want to add a negation "animals::-10" so that earth wildlife doesn't show up. 
Please make a prompt by the theory and append --ar 16:9 --v 5 and do not allow any punctuation to touch the ::X prompts
